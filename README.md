# Randomball
The code you have provided is a simple HTML document that creates a container and then uses JavaScript to draw random balls on the container. The balls bounce off the edges of the container and each other.the  section of an HTML document contains the content of the document.
This div element is the container for the balls. It has a width of 1000 pixels, a border of 5 pixels, a height of 600 pixels, and a background color of white.
the script element is used to add JavaScript code to the document.
# steps to Run the Project
this code declares variables to store the colors of the balls, the balls themselves, the x and y positions of the balls, the x and y velocities of the balls, and the gravity.
the factory() function creates n balls.
The for() loop creates a new ball for each iteration of the loop. The Math.floor() function is used to round the random numbers down to the nearest integer. The Math.random() function generates a random number between 0 and 1. The document.createElement() function creates a new HTML element. The ball.style.backgroundColor property sets the background color of the ball. The ball.style.width and ball.style.height properties set the width and height of the ball. The ball.style.borderRadius property sets the border radius of the ball. The ball.style.position property sets the position of the ball to absolute. The ball.style.zIndex property sets the z-index of the ball to 5. The document.getElementById() function gets the element with the id container. The appendChild() method appends the ball to the container element. The balls.push() method adds
# Future Improvements
This Project can be Further enhanced by adding special effects like the balls hitting a special target
